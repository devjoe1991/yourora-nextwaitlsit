# Miha - Product Requirements Document (Enhanced)

---

## 1. Vision & Principles

**Vision:**  
Build the social layer of everyday effort. Miha turns each workout or positive habit into a proud, judgment-free daily post that fuels accountability via streaks and community.

**Product Principles:**
- **Effort > Aesthetics:** We reward showing up, not perfection. A quick selfie after a walk or a screenshot of a finished workout is more valuable than a heavily edited gym photo.  
- **Kind Accountability:** Our community thrives on friendly nudges and genuine support. We're a cheer squad, not a competition.  
- **Daily Ritual:** The core loop is designed to be completed in less than 30 seconds. It's about a quick, satisfying check-in that fits seamlessly into your day.  
- **Privacy-First:** Users have granular control over who sees their posts and personal information. We respect and protect their data.  
- **Zero Friction:** The posting flow is a one-tap process‚Äîcamera ‚Üí post ‚Üí streak‚Äîmaking it incredibly simple to maintain consistency.

## 2. The Problem & The Power of Social Proof

**The Problem:**  
The fitness journey is often a lonely one. Motivation wanes, and without a reliable support system, even the best intentions can fail. Many social platforms focus on aspirational, "finish-line" content, which can feel intimidating and discouraging for people just starting out. There's no dedicated space to share and celebrate the small, daily acts of effort that truly build a consistent habit.

**The Solution:**  
Miha is a streak-driven, fitness-first social app that leverages the power of social accountability and social proof to keep users engaged and consistent. By posting daily proof of effort, users not only track their personal progress but also contribute to a collective environment of positive action.  

Each user's post, no matter how small, serves as a ripple effect‚Äîa **"butterfly effect" of motivation**‚Äîinspiring their followers and the wider community to show up and keep their own streaks alive.

## 3. Target Users & Their Needs

**Target Users:**  
Our core audience is the "everyday mover" and the "status tracker"‚Äîindividuals who find satisfaction in tracking their progress and celebrating small wins.

- **Everyday Movers:** Simple daily activities like walks, home workouts, or yoga. Motivated by consistency over intensity.  
- **Lifestyle Changers:** Weight-loss or habit-building journeys, needing a supportive, non-judgmental community.  
- **Beginner to Intermediate Gym-Goers:** Building a habit, wanting to share progress without pressure.  
- **Status Trackers (critical segment):** Love streaks, badges, progress bars. Motivated by visual representation of effort and fear of breaking streaks. Highly responsive to positive reinforcement and visual feedback.  

**Jobs To Be Done (JTBD):**
1. When I finish a workout, I want to quickly log proof and keep my streak so I can stay consistent.  
2. When my motivation dips, I want supportive nudges and accountability from my friends so I don‚Äôt fall off.  
3. When I'm curious, I want to see others‚Äô daily efforts to feel part of a collective journey.
